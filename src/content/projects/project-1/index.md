# Luku Lake - A Frontend Journey

Taking a trip down memory lane, I originally built Luku Lake's landing page back in 2021 using __Vue 2__ and __Tailwind
CSS__.
In 2024, I decided to give it a fresh spin by rebuilding it from scratch with some of the newest tools in the frontend
world.

### The Revival (2024):

I dove into **SvelteKit** and **Svelte 5** to rebuild this product landing page, which showcases Luku Lake's beautiful
collection of children's natural footwear. The rebuild wasn't just about using new tech – it was about creating
something smoother and more engaging:

- Switched to **PandaCSS** for styling, which made the codebase cleaner and more maintainable
- Added buttery-smooth scrolling with **Lenis**
- Brought the page to life with **Motion** animations
- Kept the original clean, minimalist design while making everything feel more responsive

**Cool Features:**

- Smooth transitions between sections that react to your scroll
- Snappy image loading that doesn't slow things down
- Interactive product showcases that catch your eye

This project was a fun way to experiment with modern frontend tools while breathing new life into a previous design. It
shows how fast web development evolves and how keeping up with new tech can lead to better user experiences.
